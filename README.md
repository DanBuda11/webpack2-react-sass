## Simple Webpack 2 setup with ReactJS & Sass

This was created as a result of needing to update a project that was using a really early version of Webpack 1 that was configred by someone else. In order to get everything up and running again and a little more updated I put this little ditty together.

It's just a really simple Webpack setup using the latest version 2 (2.6.1) and includes ReactJS & Sass compiling. Uses [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) to run everything and [url-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/url-loader) to return a DataURL for smaller images.
