**Simple Webpack 2 setup with ReactJS & Sass

This was created as a result of needing to update a project that was using a really early version of Webpack 1 that was configred by someone else. In order to get everything up and running again and a little more updated I put this little ditty together.

It's just a really simple Webpack setup using the latest version 2 (2.6.1) and includes ReactJS & Sass compiling. Specific scripts for running the local dev server and building the production code are included, as well as some template code and starter files to test that it all works.
